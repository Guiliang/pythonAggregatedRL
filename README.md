# README

This is a repository of code used for research related to the state aggregation paper by [Hutter (2014)](http://arxiv.org/abs/1407.3341)

It might be helpful if you are looking for implementations of some simple reinforcement learning agents in Python.

The agents it implements are:
 * Q-Learning
 * Value Iteration
 * TD-lambda with responsibility traces
 * [U-Tree](http://web.media.mit.edu%2F~tristan%2FClasses%2FMAS.945%2FPapers%2FContextual%2FMcCallum_Thesis.pdf&usg=AFQjCNEQLBx-fZS-tzIJL0HiTY7gS-rdSQ&sig2=Tb6rtJ8fB-ZLsU0OU8q5wg)

A good place to start is with the notebooks "Random_MDP_experiments.ipynb" and "Mountain_Car_Expts.ipynb", which demonstrate running some reinforcement learning experiments from the Experiments.py module and generating some plots.
